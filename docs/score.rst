The way the predictions are evaluated in the paper is by using the `coefficient of determination`_ between the predictions and the actual value. This is done for all the predictions at multiple library lengths. If the predictions for :math:`X_1` are better than :math:`X_2` than it is said that :math:`X_1` influences :math:`X_2`.
