### [Documentation][ccm-docs]

Scikit Convergent Cross Mapping (skccm) can be used as a way to detect causality
between time series.

For a quick explanation of this package, I suggest checking out the [Documentation][ccm-docs] as well as the wikipedia article on [convergent cross mapping][ccm-wiki] . Additionally,
[Dr. Sugihara's lab][sugihara-lab] has produced some good summary videos about the topic:

1. [Time Series and Dynamic Manifolds][yt-dynamic-manifolds]
2. [Reconstructed Shadow Manifold][yt-reconstructed-manifolds]
3. [State Space Reconstruction: Convergent Cross Mapping][yt-ccm]


For a more complete background, I suggest checking out the following papers:

1. [Detecting Causality in Complex Ecosystems by Sugihara][ccm-paper]
2. [Distinguishing time-delayed causal interactions using convergent cross mapping by Ye][ye-paper]

Sugihara also has a good [talk about about Correlation and Causation][causation-talk]
